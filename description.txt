Introduction
This data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. 

Data Understanding
There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

1. Request id: A unique identifier of the request
2. Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
3. Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed
4. Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
5. Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
6. Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled
by the driver or no cars available

It contains 6754 rows and 6 columns.

Problem statement
Identify the data quality issues and clean the data so that you can use it for analysis.
Ensure that the dates and time are in the proper format. Derive new variables which will
be useful for analysis.
What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap?
